# Weather App

This is a web application built using modern JavaScript syntax and APIs to provide users with up-to-date weather information for any location in the world. The app uses the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/api) to convert user-provided location information into geographic coordinates, which are then passed to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the latest weather data for the corresponding location.

The design is responsive to all screen sizes.

**This is my API based project and the 23rd project so far.**

## Features

- Easy location search: Users can search for weather information using any keyword, such as country, state, city, street, or even landmark.
- Current weather information: The app provides users with current weather conditions for the specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.
- Forecast: Users can view a 5-day forecast for the selected location, including high and low temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## Usage

To use the app, simply enter a location in the search bar at the top of the page and press Enter. The app will use the OpenCage Geocoding API to convert the location into geographic coordinates, which are then used to retrieve the latest weather data from the OpenWeather API. The current weather information will be displayed on the left-hand side of the page, and the forecast will be displayed on the right-hand side.
